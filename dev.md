# Development and testing notes

## ZooKeeper

For a local ZK test environment you can use [mbabineau/zookeeper-exhibitor](https://hub.docker.com/r/mbabineau/zookeeper-exhibitor/).
Note to replace `HOSTNAME=mh9` with the value for your host:

```bash
$ docker run -p 8181:8181 -p 2181:2181 -p 2888:2888 -p 3888:3888 -e HOSTNAME=mh9 mbabineau/zookeeper-exhibitor:latest
```

Once above container is running (make sure with `docker ps | grep mbabineau`), confirm Exhibitor is running:

```bash
$ http localhost:8181/exhibitor/v1/cluster/status
```

Also, check if ZK is playing along:

```bash
$ telnet localhost 2181
Trying ::1...
telnet: connect to address ::1: Connection refused
Trying 127.0.0.1...
Connected to localhost.
Escape character is '^]'.
ruok
imokConnection closed by foreign host.
```

Note: Exhibitor's UI is at [localhost:8181/exhibitor/v1/ui/index.html](http://localhost:8181/exhibitor/v1/ui/index.html) available.

With the following command we can read out the config:

```bash
$ http localhost:8181/exhibitor/v1/config/get-state
